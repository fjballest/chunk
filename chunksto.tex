\begin{abstract}
  To manage stacked region mappings, Advice needs a data structure
  where mapped regions could be reflected. Such data structure should
  contain information about such regions in such a way that a
  stacking order is maintained.
  
  This document describes the ``chunk store''; the data structure used
  in Advice to manage stacked mappings.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}


Advice is a Distributed Virtual Memory system providing only one
abstraction, the distributed address space (\textsc{das} for short). A
\textsc{das} is a (sparse) chunk of memory
\cite{ballesteros96:_advice,ballesteros96:_adviceobjs}. Operations are
provided to map a region onto another and also to unmap it.  Each
\textsc{das} has a set of mappings and for each mapping there's an
object named \emph{owner}. The owner is responsible for cooperation
with it's \textsc{das} to manage its pages. You can see
figure~\ref{fig:regs} to get the whole picture.

In what follows we will describe the ``Chunk Store'' data structure
and its implementation. Advice uses it to keep track of stacked region
mappings.
